# Design System: CCPun Homepage

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Golden Compass"**

CCPun's visual language is built on one premise: a person of genuine expertise handing you a precision instrument — something that orients, clarifies, and earns trust through quality alone. The dark warm-charcoal surfaces create an intimate atmosphere, while the muted gold speaks of accumulated value rather than performative wealth. This is not a bank. This is a person.

The system is deliberately warm without being casual. Warmth is carried through temperature (the charcoal has a red-orange undertone, not cold grey), through typography (Kanit's humanist geometry reads Thai and Latin with equal dignity), and through controlled use of gold as a signal of care rather than luxury. Glass effects appear only where there is something to elevate — a button the user is about to press, a modal that deserves to float above the world.

What this system explicitly rejects: the cold institutional aesthetic of Thai state banks (SCB, Krungthai), the amateur clip-art energy of generic insurance agent sites, and the untouchable distance of luxury lifestyle brands. CCPun must feel like it was made by someone who knows your name.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Dark-warm, not dark-cold — charcoal surfaces carry red-orange undertone
- Gold as signal of care, not of wealth
- Glass reserved for interactive elevation, not decoration
- Kanit for all type: Thai/Latin parity at one typeface weight range
- Framer Motion for transitions that feel intentional, not reflexive

## 2. Colors: The Compass Palette

Two poles define the system: deep warm charcoal at the base, muted gold at the signal layer. Every other token is a controlled step between them.

### Primary
- **Warm Gold** (`#e0c985`): The compass needle. Used exclusively on primary CTAs, active nav states, link hovers, and the single accent per section that earns the user's attention. Never used as a background for large areas.
- **Gold Bright** (`#ebd9a2`): Hover and highlighted state. Lighter, never heavier, than Warm Gold.
- **Gold Deep** (`#d1b561`): Pressed/active states and blockquote accents. Grounded, not glowing.

### Neutral
- **Ink** (`#faf9f9`): Primary text. Near-white with a faint warm undertone — not clinical white.
- **Ink Muted** (`#baabab`): Secondary text, captions, timestamps, helper copy. Must pass 4.5:1 against Surface.
- **Surface** (`#4a3a3a`): Card and elevated container background. Glass cards use this at 0.6 opacity.
- **Main Background** (`#352727`): The page canvas. Warm dark charcoal — the room the user inhabits.
- **Deep Charcoal** (`#251818`): Deepest background layer, scrollbar track, innermost nested containers.
- **Border Subtle** (`#5b4848`): All dividers and card outlines. Never used as a design accent.

### Named Rules
**The One Compass Rule.** Warm Gold appears on at most one primary CTA per viewport. It is a signal, not a decoration. If every button is gold, none of them are.

**The Temperature Rule.** Never introduce a neutral that trends toward cool grey or blue-grey. All neutrals — surface, bg, ink — must carry the red-orange hue of the charcoal base. Mixing in a cool neutral breaks the room.

## 3. Typography

**Display / Body Font:** Kanit (Thai-first, with system-ui fallback)
**No secondary typeface.** One family, weight contrast.

**Character:** Kanit at light (300) for body and bold (600–700) for headings creates a generous weight contrast without requiring a second face. The geometric structure reads as modern and precise; the Thai-native design ensures no visual downgrade when rendering Thai copy. The personality is confident without being aggressive.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (700, clamp(2.5rem → 4rem), lh 1.1, ls -0.02em): Hero headlines only. One per page.
- **Headline** (600, clamp(1.75rem → 2.5rem), lh 1.2, ls -0.01em): Section titles. `text-wrap: balance` always applied.
- **Title** (500, 1.25rem, lh 1.4): Card headings, subsection labels, nav items.
- **Body** (300, 1rem, lh 1.6): All prose. Max line length 65–75ch. `text-wrap: pretty` for orphan control.
- **Label** (500, 0.875rem, lh 1.4): Button text, form labels, badges, metadata. Thai-first abbreviation conventions.

### Named Rules
**The One-Family Rule.** Kanit is the only typeface. Do not introduce a serif display face "for elegance" or a mono for code snippets unless the UI genuinely requires it. Weight contrast IS the hierarchy.

**The Thai-First Rule.** All copy renders in Thai by default. English terms appear only where there is no Thai equivalent. Never uppercase Thai text — it has no case.

## 4. Elevation

CCPun uses purposeful glass elevation. Surfaces are flat at rest; glass appears only when a layer genuinely floats above the content below it — navigation, modals, tooltips, active cards.

**The three layers:**
1. **Page canvas** (Main Background `#352727`) — flat, no shadow
2. **Content surface** (Surface `#4a3a3a`) — flat or with ambient glass shadow for cards
3. **Floating chrome** (glass at 0.6 opacity) — navbar, modals, interactive overlays

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Glass ambient** (`0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.3), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`): Applied to glass-layer cards and panels. The inset highlight is the glass edge.
- **Gold glow** (`0 4px 24px rgba(197,160,89,0.4)`): Applied to primary CTA buttons in their default state. Signals the actionable layer.
- **Gold glow large** (`0 8px 32px rgba(197,160,89,0.5)`): Hover state for primary CTA. Never on static elements.

### Named Rules
**The Purposeful Glass Rule.** Glass is reserved for the interactive layer that floats above content. Do not apply backdrop-filter to section backgrounds, hero overlays, or decorative cards that are not interactive. Glass used decoratively dilutes the signal.

**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** Content sections, text blocks, and non-interactive containers carry no shadow. Depth is created through tonal layering (main-bg → surface → deep-charcoal), not shadows.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
Tactile and confident — pressing a CCPun button should feel like using a quality instrument.

- **Shape:** Gently curved (14px radius)
- **Primary:** Warm Gold background (`#e0c985`) with Deep Charcoal text (`#251818`). Padding 12px 28px. Gold glow shadow always present.
- **Primary Hover:** Gold Bright (`#ebd9a2`) background. Gold glow large shadow. Subtle upward translate (-2px).
- **Ghost:** Transparent background, Warm Gold border (1px) and text. Used for secondary CTAs.
- **Transition:** All transitions 200ms ease-out. No bounce, no spring.

### Cards / Glass Panels
- **Corner Style:** 16px radius (rounded-lg)
- **Background:** Surface (`#4a3a3a`) at 60% opacity with backdrop-blur-md
- **Glass border:** `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` — the edge that makes it read as glass
- **Shadow:** Glass ambient shadow
- **Internal Padding:** 24px (spacing-md)
- **Rule:** Never nest a glass card inside another glass card.

### Navigation
- **Style:** Glass panel, fixed, backdrop-blur. Gold underline for active link (not background highlight).
- **Typography:** Title weight (500), 0.875rem
- **Mobile:** Slide-in drawer, same glass treatment.
- **Active state:** Gold bottom border, no background tint.

### Inputs / Forms
- **Style:** Surface background, border-subtle outline (1px), 14px radius
- **Focus:** Gold ring (2px, warm-gold, 2px offset). Never colored background on focus.
- **Error:** Red-adjacent destructive color, message below field, not replacing the label.

### Signature: Hero CTA Block
The main conversion surface. Dark glass panel, large display headline, body copy, primary button with gold glow. The gold compass metaphor lives here — one directional signal in an otherwise restrained composition.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** use Warm Gold on at most one primary CTA per viewport. Its scarcity is the point.
- **Do** apply `text-wrap: balance` to all headlines (h1–h3) to prevent ragged breaks.
- **Do** use the inset white highlight (`inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`) on every glass element — it is what makes glass read as glass.
- **Do** apply Framer Motion's `ease-out` easing (no bounce, no elastic) for all entrance animations.
- **Do** add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` alternatives for every animation — Thai Gen X users on desktop may be in accessibility contexts.
- **Do** verify `ink-muted` (#baabab) passes 4.5:1 against Surface (#4a3a3a) before using it for body copy. It is borderline; increase weight if it fails.
- **Do** use Kanit 300 (light) for body copy — it reads cleanly at Thai paragraph density.

### Don't:
- **Don't** use gradient text (`background-clip: text`). It looks cheap against the Compass palette.
- **Don't** apply glassmorphism to section backgrounds, decorative dividers, or hero overlays that are not interactive. That is the decorative reflex this system explicitly rejects.
- **Don't** introduce a second typeface. Kanit is the system. Mixing in a serif "for elegance" breaks the Thai-first identity.
- **Don't** make the interface look like a Thai state bank (cold neutrals, government blue, formal ceremony) — it must feel personal, not institutional.
- **Don't** make it look like a generic Thai insurance agent site (stock photos, low-contrast text, clip-art decorations, amateur layout).
- **Don't** make it look like a Bulgari-style luxury brand (untouchable, distant, art-gallery whitespace) — CCPun must be reachable.
- **Don't** use `border-left` as a colored accent stripe on cards or callouts. Rewrite with a background tint or full border.
- **Don't** use identical card grids. If three cards appear in a row, vary their size, content density, or weight to create rhythm.
- **Don't** use all-caps Thai text at any size. Reserve uppercase for English-only labels (≤4 words).
- **Don't** animate CSS layout properties. Only transform and opacity for performance.
