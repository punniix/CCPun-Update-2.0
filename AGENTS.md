# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# CCPun Engineering Constitution

This repository powers `ccpun.com`. Treat SEO continuity, consent, analytics continuity, and production content as protected contracts rather than ordinary implementation details.

Read `docs/engineering-workflow-v1.md` before making repository-wide, SEO, analytics, Sanity, routing, or deployment changes.

## Repository architecture

Read `docs/architecture/repository-architecture.md` before adding significant files or features.

Before creating a source file:

1. Identify its feature/domain owner and prefer an existing directory.
2. Keep `app/` focused on routes and composition.
3. Put feature-specific UI/logic under `features/`.
4. Put cross-feature UI under `components/` and shared infrastructure under a named `lib/` domain.
5. Do not create a new top-level directory or a second naming convention without architectural justification.
6. Do not recreate legacy paths merely because old code used them.
7. Run `npm run test:architecture` after structural changes.

Before modifying Sanity:

1. Treat schema type and field names as persisted data contracts; never rename a schema `name` casually.
2. Put editorial documents in `cms/sanity/schema/documents/`, reusable objects in `cms/sanity/schema/objects/`, and system intelligence records in `cms/sanity/admin/schema/`.
3. Preserve environment/project/dataset isolation, Article URL locks, review/publish guards, and Studio lifecycle restrictions.
4. Keep URL/taxonomy ownership in `lib/content/`, not CMS schema.
5. Never modify Production content without explicit task-specific approval.
6. Validate the schema and Admin/environment boundaries after changes.

## 1. Delivery workflow

- Production branch: `v4-production`.
- Never edit `v4-production` directly. Work on a feature/fix/refactor branch.
- Normal path: branch -> implementation -> tests -> Pull Request -> CI -> Vercel Preview -> human review -> merge.
- Do not merge a PR or trigger a Production deployment unless the user explicitly asks for that action in the current task.
- Vercel Preview is the validation target for branch work. `ccpun.com` is not a test environment.
- Keep changes surgical. Do not mix unrelated URL, content, analytics, and visual changes in one experiment when the effects need to be measured separately.

## 2. Environment and Sanity safety

- Production Sanity is read-only by default for agent work.
- Use Sanity UAT for drafts, schema experiments, and content experiments unless Production write/publish is explicitly approved.
- Importing or staging content is not publication.
- Never publish, unpublish, delete, bulk-migrate, or rewrite Production content unless the user explicitly asks for that exact Production action.
- Preserve the existing environment boundaries in `lib/admin/environment.ts`, `cms/sanity/policy/studio-policy.ts`, and their tests.
- Never commit tokens, API keys, OAuth secrets, Vercel secrets, Sanity tokens, or private credentials.

## 3. SEO and URL safety

The current physical URL structure is a stability layer. Semantic topic classification is a separate knowledge-graph layer.

- Do not assume a semantic topic must equal the physical category segment in the canonical URL.
- Do not change a published slug, canonical, redirect, category path, sitemap ownership, or indexability merely to make the URL look semantically cleaner.
- Any URL migration requires explicit approval and a coordinated release covering redirect, canonical, sitemap, internal links, schema, and regression tests.
- Check `qa/legacy-url-ledger.json`, `lib/content/url.ts`, `lib/content/taxonomy.ts`, and `cms/sanity/migration-contract.md` before touching URL ownership.
- Avoid redirect chains. Historical URLs must resolve directly to the final approved canonical destination.
- One Search Intent = One Owner. Do not create a new indexable URL when an existing owner can satisfy the same intent.
- Protect winner pages from destructive rewrites while migration signals are consolidating.
- AIA Health CI Hero is health/medical-expense insurance with critical-illness conditions/triggers. It is NOT critical-illness lump-sum insurance and must not be routed to `/ci-planning/` as a lump-sum product.
- Before UX/UI 4.2, AIA Health Happy and AIA Health CI Hero have approved final physical/canonical owners under `/blog/health-insurance/...`. Their former `/blog/life-insurance/...` paths and historical WordPress URLs must redirect directly to those Health URLs with no intermediate hop.
- Other semantic/physical exceptions may remain until separately approved; do not infer a physical URL migration from semantic topic alone.

Protected SEO surfaces include, at minimum:

- `lib/content/url.ts`
- `lib/content/taxonomy.ts`
- `qa/legacy-url-ledger.json`
- `app/robots.ts`
- `app/sitemap.xml/`
- `app/sitemaps/`
- article metadata/canonical generation
- Sanity SEO canonical/noindex controls

## 4. Analytics and consent safety

The existing application event layer and consent behavior are historical-data contracts.

- Application components should emit semantic business events through the existing analytics layer rather than calling GA4, Meta, or future ad providers directly.
- Preserve `lib/analytics.ts` as the central event/mapping boundary unless an explicitly approved migration replaces it.
- Do not bypass `trackEvent()` by adding ad-hoc `gtag`, `fbq`, or provider calls inside feature components.
- Do not disable, remove, or delay GA4/GTM/Meta/Consent functionality just to improve performance scores without explicit approval and tracking evidence.
- Consent must remain authoritative. Never emit analytics or social events that violate the stored consent state.
- Never send calculator answers, financial values, health details, names, emails, phone numbers, or other personal/sensitive data to analytics unless an explicitly reviewed data contract allows it.
- Do not silently rename existing production events. Historical continuity matters.
- Preserve the tracking/consent regression contracts in `tests/analytics-regression.ts` and `qa/tracking-consent-regression.mjs`.

Protected tracking surfaces include, at minimum:

- `lib/analytics.ts`
- `lib/cookie-consent.ts`
- `features/analytics/components/GoogleAnalytics.tsx`
- `features/analytics/components/GoogleTagManager.tsx`
- `features/analytics/components/MetaPixel.tsx`
- `features/analytics/components/CookieConsent.tsx`
- `qa/tracking-consent-regression.mjs`
- `tests/analytics-regression.ts`

## 5. Required checks

Before opening or updating a PR, run the repository checks that are available in the execution environment.

Baseline:

```bash
npm run check:foundation
```

For URL/SEO routing changes, also run the relevant URL/topic regression suite. Live Production HTTP checks must be read-only.

For analytics/consent changes, run the analytics regression suite and, when the browser/CDP test environment and required public IDs are available, `npm run qa:tracking`.

Never make a failing test pass by deleting the assertion, weakening a safety contract, disabling consent, or excluding the affected route unless the underlying contract was explicitly changed and approved.

## 6. Agent completion report

Every substantial task should report:

1. What changed and why.
2. Files/surfaces affected.
3. Tests run and their results.
4. Vercel Preview status when applicable.
5. Whether SEO URLs, Sanity Production, analytics, or consent changed.
6. Known risks and rollback path.

If a requested change conflicts with these rules, stop the risky part, explain the conflict, and propose the safest implementation that preserves the user's intended outcome.
